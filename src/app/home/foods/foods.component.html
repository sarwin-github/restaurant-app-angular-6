Big winners are the Inihaw na Pla-Pla (also known as tilapia), and the inihaw na Hito. All his cooks are native chefs, so one can expect an authentic taste of Tayabas in their dishes. Other dishes, worthy of praise are the Inihaw na Spare Ribs, Squid in Oyster Sauce, and their own version of Salpicao (mixed vegatable & seafoods). </h5>
